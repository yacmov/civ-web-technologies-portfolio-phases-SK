          <h2>Teacher + Student = dumb and dumber</h2>
          <p>
            This content is derived from APC Magazine, November 2007. We had no
            idea there were so many dumb IT trainers and students out there. The
            stories just keep coming in.

          <h3>COPY, COPY</h3>
          <p>
            David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever
            pair of IT Diploma students who handed in a joint research
            assignment, complete with the required signed statement that it was
            all their original work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly
            impressed to find three pages of the document written in perfect
            technical German, particularly given that the students in question
            were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
          </p>
          <p>
            End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care
            taken when cutting and pasting to cover assignment work.

          <h3>THAT'S MY LECTURE</h3>
          <p>
            Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows
            the subject. But IT lecturers are a funny lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for
            school staff, as there was a presentation. Having done that, I
            hooked the presentation laptop to the network and tried to help one
            of the speakers from the IT faculty update the laptop to IE7. I
            logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try IE7.
          </p>
          <p>
            'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether
            phishing should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that
            she was about to present a talk on internet security."

          <h3>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h3>
          <p>
            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an
            incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift,
            library staff are the default computer technicians/troubleshooters.
            One night, this part-time lecturer came to the counter, stating that
            she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc stuck in the drive. She also said
            she felt a bit foolish, because she was instructing a class in basic
            computing and was unable to solve the problem in front of a room
            full of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject
            button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
            'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to
            an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the
            drives themselves had long since been decommissioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the
            machine and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the
            lecturer her CD back, she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You
            won't believe it, I've done it again!'
          </p>
          <p>
            And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her
            class, shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching
            people to handle their computers with care!"
